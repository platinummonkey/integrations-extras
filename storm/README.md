# Storm Integration

## Overview

Get metrics from Storm service in real time to:

* Visualize and monitor Storm cluster and topology metrics.
* Be notified about Storm failovers and events.

## Setup

The Storm check is **NOT** included in the [Datadog Agent][1] package.

### Installation

To install the Storm check on your host:

1. [Download the Datadog Agent][1].
2. Download the [`check.py` file][2] for Storm.
3. Place it in the Agent's `checks.d` directory.
4. Rename it to `storm.py`.

### Configuration

To configure the Storm check:

1. Create a `storm.d/` folder in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your Agent's directory.
2. Create a `conf.yaml` file in the `storm.d/` folder previously created.
3. Consult the [sample storm.yaml][2] file and copy its content in the `conf.yaml` file.
4. Edit the `conf.yaml` file to point to your server and port, set the masters to monitor.
5. [Restart the Agent][3].

## Validation

[Run the Agent's `status` subcommand][4] and look for `storm` under the Checks section.
