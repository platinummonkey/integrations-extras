## Overview

Collect custom metrics from your application with a few clicks and send it to Datadog. No need to write code, redeploy or restart your app.

* Enhance monitoring and expedite production debugging with Rookout's on-demand data collection
* Collect custom metrics ad-hoc from Rookout without the need for new instrumentation

**Note: Since this integration enables you to collect custom metrics, there may be billing implications based on the number of custom metrics collected. More information on custom metrics can be [found here][11].**

## Setup

### Installation

Rookout sends data to Datadog via the DogStatsD service available from the Datadog Agent.

1. Install the [Datadog Agent][1] and [Rookout][2]

2. Log into [Rookout's webapp][3]

3. In the right panel (Rules) click on the menu button

6. Click the save icon to save the template

7. Add the newly created rule to any application as you would normally

### Configuration

You can configure the rule to use specific actions, every rule should contain these attributes in the `processing.operations` object:

```
{
    "name": "dogstatsd",
    "action": "<ACTION>",
    "metric": "<METRIC_NAME>",
    "target": {
      "host": "<HOST_NAME>",
      "port": 8125
    }
}
```

Depending on the actions, it needs different additional attributes:

```
| Datadog Action |  Attributes |
|----------------|-------------|
|    increment   | value       |
|    decrement   | value       |
|      event     | title, text |
|      gauge     | value       |
|    histogram   | value       |
|     timing     | value       |
|  distribution  | value       |
```

For more information about these actions you can see [Dogstatsd documentation][9]

Any attribute must be formatted the following way to be accepted by our rule:

```
"value": {
    "name": "calc",
    "path": "123"
}
```

```
"value": {
    "name": "calc",
    "path": "\"string\""
}
```

## Data Collected
You can collect custom metrics and events by creating a Datadog output in your Rookout rule. Some commonly used patterns:

* Count the number of a times a method is invoked (increment)
* Document process started in DataDog (event)
* Record batch sizes (histogram)
