# Redis Sentinel

## Overview

Get metrics from Redis's Sentinel service in real time to:

* Visualize and monitor sentinels states
* Be notified about failovers


## Setup

The Redis's Sentinel check is **NOT** included in the [Datadog Agent][1] package.

### Installation

To install the Redis's Sentinel check on your host:

1. [Download the Datadog Agent][1].
2. Download the [`check.py` file][2] for Redis's Sentinel.
3. Place it in the Agent's `checks.d` directory.
4. Rename it to `redis_sentinel.py`.

### Configuration

To configure the Redis's Sentinel check:

1. Create a `redis_sentinel.d/` folder in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your Agent's directory.
2. Create a `conf.yaml` file in the `redis_sentinel.d/` folder previously created.
3. Consult the [sample redis_sentinel.yaml][2] file and copy its content in the `conf.yaml` file.
4. Edit the `conf.yaml` file to point to your server and port, set the masters to monitor.
5. [Restart the Agent][3].

## Validation

[Run the Agent's `status` subcommand][4] and look for `redis_sentinel` under the Checks section.
