# Agent Check: Aqua

## Overview

This check monitors [Aqua][1].

The Aqua check will alert the user if total high-severity vulnerability is reached, or if a container is running inside a host not registered by Aqua. Aqua will also send data alerts regarding blocked events in runtime, and it is possible to trigger a webhook to scale infrastructure if more Aqua scanners are required.

## Setup

The Aqua check is not included in the [Datadog Agent][2] package, so you will
need to install it yourself.

### Installation

To install the Aqua check on your host:

1. [Download the Datadog Agent][2].
2. Download the [`aqua.py` file][8] for Aqua.
3. Place it in the Agent's `checks.d` directory.

### Configuration

To configure the Aqua check: 

1. Create a `aqua.d/` folder in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your Agent's directory. 
2. Create a `conf.yaml` file in the `aqua.d/` folder previously created.
3. Consult the [sample conf.yaml][3] file and copy its content in the `conf.yaml` file.
4. Edit the `conf.yaml` file with your Aqua API credentials.
5. [Restart the Agent][4].

### Validation

[Run the Agent's `status` subcommand][5] and look for `aqua` under the Checks section.
