# traefik Integration

## Overview

This integration collects data from Traefik and checks its health.

## Setup

### Configuration

Create a `traefik.yaml` in the Datadog Agent's `conf.d` directory.

#### Metric Collection

Add this configuration setup to your `traefik.yaml` file to start gathering your [metrics][2]:

```
init_config:

instances:
  - host: 10.1.2.3
    port: "8080"
    path: "/health"
```

Configuration Options:

- host: Traefik endpoint to query. __Required__
- port: API listener of Traefik endpoint. Default value `8080`. _Optional_
- path: Path of Traefik health check endpoint. Default `/health`. _Optional_

[Restart the Agent][3] to begin sending Traefik metrics to Datadog.

### Validation

[Run the Agent's `status` subcommand][4] and look for `traefik` under the Checks section:

```
  Checks
  ======
    [...]

    traefik
    -------
      - instance #0 [OK]
      - Collected 2 metrics, 0 events & 1 service check

    [...]
```

## Compatibility

The check is compatible with all major platforms.

## Data Collected

### Metrics

See [metadata.csv][5] for a list of metrics provided by this integration.

### Events

The Traefik check does not include any events at this time.

### Service Checks

Query Traefik and expect `200` as return status code.
