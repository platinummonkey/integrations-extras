# EventStore Integration

## Overview

Get metrics from Eventstore in real time to:

* Visualize and monitor EventStore queues
* capture all available metrics within the stats api

## Setup

### Installation

Install the `dd-check-eventstore` package manually or with your favourite configuration manager

### Configuration

  1. Edit the eventstore.d/conf.yaml file, in the conf.d/ folder at the root of your Agent's configuration directory to start collecting your eventstore performance data. See the sample eventstore.d/eventstore.yaml.default for all available configuration options.

  2. Restart the Agent

### Validation

Run the Agent's `status` subcommand and look for `eventstore` under the Checks section:

       Checks
       ======

       eventstore
       -----------
        - instance #0 [OK]
        - Collected 50 metrics, 0 events & 0 service checks


## Compatibility

The check is compatible with all major platforms.
